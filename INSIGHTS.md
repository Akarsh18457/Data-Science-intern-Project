Executive Summary — Trader Performance vs Market Sentiment
Objective

This analysis examines how Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear vs Greed) influences trader behavior and performance on Hyperliquid. By aligning daily trader metrics with sentiment regimes, we identify behavioral shifts, performance differences, and actionable strategy insights.

Methodology

Merged daily Bitcoin Fear/Greed sentiment with Hyperliquid trade-level data.

Aggregated metrics at the trader-day level, including:

Daily PnL, win rate, trade count

Average leverage, position size, long/short ratio

PnL volatility as a drawdown proxy

Performed trader segmentation using behavioral and performance features.

Visual evidence includes boxplots, bar charts, and segment summary tables.

Key Findings
1. Performance Differs Significantly by Sentiment

Greed days show higher and more stable daily PnL and win rates.

Fear days exhibit substantially higher PnL volatility, indicating deeper drawdowns.

Overall, trader performance deteriorates under Fear sentiment due to increased risk and inconsistency.

Evidence: Daily PnL boxplots and PnL volatility comparisons.

2. Traders Actively Change Behavior Based on Sentiment

Trade Frequency: Higher on Greed days; reduced participation during Fear.

Leverage: Increases during Fear days, particularly among aggressive traders.

Positioning: Greed days show stronger long bias and larger position sizes.

These patterns suggest higher risk-taking during Fear despite poorer outcomes.

Evidence: Trade frequency bar charts, leverage distribution plots, long/short ratios.

3. Distinct Trader Segments Exhibit Different Sensitivities

Segment 1 — High-Leverage Traders

High volatility and large drawdowns, especially during Fear days.

Segment 2 — Frequent Traders

Benefit from Greed regimes but lose edge during Fear due to overtrading.

Segment 3 — Consistent Winners

Lower leverage, stable win rates, and best risk-adjusted performance across regimes.

Evidence: Cluster-level performance and volatility tables.

Actionable Insights

Risk Control During Fear:
High leverage during Fear increases drawdowns without improving returns.
→ Cap leverage or reduce exposure for aggressive trader segments during Fear regimes.

Selective Aggression During Greed:
Increased trade frequency is beneficial only for historically consistent traders.
→ Allow higher activity during Greed for disciplined traders, not across the board.

Final Takeaway

Market sentiment materially impacts both trader behavior and outcomes. Strategies that dynamically adjust leverage and activity based on sentiment and trader archetype can significantly improve performance and reduce downside risk.
